## Hi there 👋


### Introduction

Welcome to *TxPull* - the one-stop-shop for all your token tracking needs! Whether you're a crypto enthusiast, a seasoned investor, or just a curious cat, our real-time tracking service has got you covered.

We're like your personal token detective, sniffing out all the juicy details about BSC and Ethereum tokens, from prices to security to contract audits. We even keep tabs on users of the tokens, so you can make informed decisions about who you're dealing with.

But we don't just stop at tracking - we also take security seriously. Our team of experts diligently checks for vulnerabilities in the contracts, so you don't have to worry about falling prey to scams. Well you should, however... we will help you with that as best as we can :)

We provide an intuitive API that lets you easily purchase and sell tokens without having to be a greedy bot. Plus, we've got big plans to support other networks in the future, so you can stay on top of the ever-evolving crypto landscape.

In fact, all capabilities will be provided in API that will have fair pricing. Only new data will be charged properly. Data that we already store will come for free, however, with some limitations on the RPS (Requests Per Second).

More on that in the future.

So, if you want to be in the know about tokens, look no further. Our prices may be undefined for now, but our commitment to excellence is always crystal clear.

**NOTE: We are currently in alpha, nothing is yet online, but will be, soon.**
